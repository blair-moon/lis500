               <h3> Blair Moon </h3>
               <p>Hello, my name is Blair majoring in <b>Information Science.</b> I have worked in mass media fields as an intern editor, and I have experience running social media accounts for the department. I am not currently working for a specific company, but I have been building on a personal photography portfolio consistently. I am aiming to become a data journalism specialist, but I also have a willingness to advance into fields related to photography and media. Lately, I have been geeking out over analog films and camcorders, trying to keep up with the trend of newtro. It is fascinating how digital and analog can team up and create something awesome together.</p>
