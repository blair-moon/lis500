<p>Kevin Horton is my tech hero and
through his vision, he wants to bring STEM into underrepresented schools and communities. There are clear disadvantages that poorly funded schools face, and he is trying to lead these students to success by creating new opportunities. As someone who always wants to give back to the community, I see Kevin as a role model, and I hope to one day do similar actions in my neighborhood.

<h3>Why is having STEM in low income schools important?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lack of representation of minorities in the tech industry</li>
<li>Lack of resources</li>
<li>Prevent the school-to-prison pipeline</li>

</ul>
