        <h1>Who is Daniel?</h1>
        <body>
        <p> My name is Daniel and I was born and raised in the southside of Chicago. I am a junior majoring in Information science with certificates in Computer Science and Chicano Latino Studies. I enjoy learning how technology is involved in our everyday lives. I hope to implement what I learn in this class to my community.</p>
        
        <h2>My tech hero</h2>
        <p>Kevin Horton is my tech hero and
through his vision, he wants to bring STEM into underrepresented schools and communities. There are clear disadvantages that poorly funded schools face, and he is trying to lead these students to success by creating new opportunities. As someone who always wants to give back to the community, I see Kevin as a role model, and I hope to one day do similar actions in my neighborhood.
